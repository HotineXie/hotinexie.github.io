**I am currently seeking Ph.D. positions. If you are interested in me, please feel free to contact me!**

Hi 👋🙂

I am Haotian Xie (谢皓天 in Chinese), an MSCS student at [Rutgers University, New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/). My research interests span all aspects of Computer Systems with a current focus on Distributed Storage Systems and Interpretability in AI Software Engineering. I am dedicated to build engineering-heavy systems to generate real impact for a wide range of applications.

Prior to Rutgers, I worked as an infrastructure engineer at autonomous driving startups [Pony.ai](https://pony.ai/?lang=en) (Jun 2021 - Nov 2022) and [Autra.tech](https://autra.tech/) (Jan 2023 - Dec 2023). My work includes building efficient and stable CI/CD workflows based on Kubernets and Argo, building and maintaining PB-level distributed storage systems, etc.

I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en) in 2022. At CUHK(SZ), I used to work on AIOps/MLOps and Database testing with [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/) and [Dr. Boxi Yu](https://boxiyu.github.io/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
